<b>HistoEnder: a 3D printer-based histological slide autostainer that retains 3D printer functions</b>

![][1]

Automated microscope slide stainers are typically very expensive, and unless the lab performs heavy histological work 
it is hard to justify buying a €2000-€10000 machine. As a result, histology and pathology labs around the world lose 
thousands of working hours for  following a procedure that could be easily automated. Here, we propose a simple modification 
of an open-source 3D printer, the Creality Ender 3, into an automated microscope slide autostainer, the HistoEnder. 
The HistoEnder is cheap (€190), modular, and easy to set up, with only two 3D-printed parts needed. 
Additionally, the 3D printer retains its full functionality, and it can go back to 3D printing in less than 1 minute. 
The g-code associated with the procedure is extremely simple, and can be written by anyone. The HistoEnder can also be
used in chemistry and material science laboratories for automating surface modifications and dip coating.
